# Write an efficient method that checks whether any permutation ↴ of an input string is a palindrome. ↴
#
# You can assume the input string only contains lowercase letters.
#
# Examples:
#
# "civic" should return true
# "ivicc" should return true
# "civil" should return false
# "livci" should return false
# "But 'ivicc' isn't a palindrome!"
#
# If you had this thought, read the question again carefully. We're asking if any permutation of the string is a palindrome. Spend some extra time ensuring you fully understand the question before starting. Jumping in with a flawed understanding of the problem doesn't look good in an interview.
